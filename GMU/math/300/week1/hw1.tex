    \item There exists a number n in the integers such that n + 1 = 5
    \item Set n equal to 4
    \item Observe that $4 + 1 = 5 \in \mathbb{Z}$

  3. $\exists x \in \mathbb{R}: \forall y \in \mathbb{R}: x \geq y$
  \begin{itemize}
    \item There exists a real number x such that for all real numbers $y: n \geq y$

  5. \(\forall\) x \(\in \mathbb{R}\): \(\exists\) y \(\in \mathbb{R}\): xy = 1
  \begin{itemize}
    \item For all x in the reals there exists a real number y such that xy = 1.
    \item Put \(y = \frac{1}{x}\)
    \item Observe that \(x * \frac{1}{x} = 1\)

  6. \(\exists\) x \(\in \mathbb{R}\): \(\forall\) y \(\in \mathbb{R}\): xy = y
  \begin{itemize}
    \item There exists a real number x such that for all real numbers xy = y.

  7. Give an example of a proposition P for which:
  \begin{center}
  $\forall m \in \mathbb{Z}: \exists n \in \mathbb{Z}: P(m,n)$ is true
  and
  $\exists n \in \mathbb{Z}: \forall m \in \mathbb{Z}: P(m,n)$ is false
  \end{center}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item For all integers m there exists an integer n such that P(m,n) is true
    \item There exists an integer n such that for all integers m P(m,n) is false
    \item Let P = m = n
    \item Put n = m
    \item Observe that n, m $\in \mathbb{Z}$
    \item Observe that for all integers m there exists an integer n such that m = n
    \item Observe that there is not a single integer n such that for all integers m m = n
  \end{itemize}
  8. Find a Proposition Q for which:
  \begin{center}
  $\forall m \in \mathbb{Z}: \exists n \in \mathbb{Z}: Q(m,n)$ is false
  and
  $\exists n \in \mathbb{Z}: \forall m \in \mathbb{Z}: Q(m,n)$ is true
  \end{center}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item For all integers m there exists an integer n such that Q(m,n) is false
    \item There exists an integer n such that for all integers m Q(m,n) is true
    \item Put Q equal to m < n
    \item Put n = (m + 1)
    \item Observe that m, (m + 1) \(in \mathbb{Z}\)
    \item Observe that for all integers m there is an integer m - 1 such that m < (m + 1)
    \item Put m = 5 and n = 4
    \item Observe that 5 < 4 is false
    \item Observe that there does not exist a single integer n such that all integers m are greater than it.
  \end{itemize}
  9. Is the statement $\forall a \in \mathbb{A}: \forall b \in \mathbb{B}: P(a,b)$ communative and there for $\forall b \in \mathbb{B}: \forall a \in \mathbb{A}: P(a,b)$ is also true? 
  \newline
  \begin{itemize}
    \item For all numbers a in A such that for all numbers b in B satisfy P(a,b)
    \item For all numbers b in B such that for all numbers a in A satisfy P(a,b)
    \item As the order of the arguments to the proposition does not change, I would assume that switching the order of the for all statements should not effect the value of the proposition.
  \end{itemize}
  10. $\exists a \in \mathbb{A}: \exists b \in \mathbb{B}: P(a,b)$ does it follow that $\exists b \in \mathbb{B}: \exists a \in \mathbb{A}: P(a,b)$? 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item There exists a number a in Set A such that there exists a number B in set B that satisifies P(a,b)
    \item There exists a number b in Set B such that there exists a number A in Set A that satisfies P(a,b)
    \item I would also assume here that exists is communative and what matters is switching the order of the parameters to the Property.
  \end{itemize}
