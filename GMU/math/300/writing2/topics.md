- Yonneda Lemma
- Lawvere Theories and Computer Science
- Introduction to Category Theory

Fundamentals:
1. Category
  a. Objects
  b. Arrows
  c. Each arrow has a domain and codomain
  d. Arrows compose (o is a primitive)
  e. each object has an identity
  f. associativity so h o (g o f) = (h o g) o f
  g. Unit which is f 0 Id = f = Ig o f
2. Functor
  a. > A homomorphism of categories is called a functor. - Cat Theory, 8
  b. A mapping of objects to objects and arrows to arrows such that F(f: A -> B) = F(f): F(A) -> F(B).
  c. F(Id_a) = 1_f(a).
  d. F(g o f) = F(g) o F(f).
  e. Functors preserve domains, codomains, identity arrows, and composition
  f. Cat is the category of all categories
3. Natural Transformation
4. Adjunction
